Kontext is a single binary application, that takes yet another approach on kubeconfig management.


## Features

Kontext has several features, that will ease your life when dealing with different kubeconfig files.

### Context

Switch between a context by just calling the binary, without any arguments. It will read your current kubeconfig file
and list all available options.

### Groups

Groups refer to one or more sources and can be used to bundle kubeconfig files together. You
can switch between groups and enable or disable multiple sources at once.

### Sources

Source include or exclude kubeconfig files as a glob pattern. A source always computes all
included sources files first and then removes all duplicates. After the include section has
been computed the same happens for all files, that shall be excluded. Take a look at the
[example](./example/kontext.yaml) to understand sources in depth.

## Usage

```shell
[I] âžœ  kx -h
manage kubernetes config files, contexts, groups and sources

Usage:
  kontext [flags]
  kontext [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  get         get [context|group] [name], defaults to context
  help        Help about any command
  reload      reload the active group
  set         set [context|group] [name]
  version     version for kontext

Flags:
  -h, --help            help for kontext
  -v, --verbosity int   verbose output (default 3)

Use "kontext [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Verbosity

You can tweak the verbosity by using the following levels:

```shell
1 -> Trace
2 -> Debug
3 -> Info (default)
4 -> Warn
5 -> Error
6 -> Fatal
7 -> Print
```

## Installation

At the moment kontext is distributed as a single binary and can be downloaded from the
[releases](https://github.com/orbatschow/kontext/releases).

## Configuration

Have a look at the [example](./example/kontext.yaml). It should be well described and show you
how to configure kontext. Kontext will look at different paths for the configuration file, depending on
your operating system:

| Linux                          | MacOS                          | Windows                           |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| ~/.config/kontext/kontext.yaml | ~/.config/kontext/kontext.yaml | LocalAppData\kontext\kontext.yaml |

## Backups

As kontext will override your kubeconfig file pretty often, it allows you to configure backups. All
backups are placed within a dedicated backup directory, that can be configured within the configuration file.
There are defaults, that are specific to all operating systems:

| Linux                         | MacOS                                        | Windows                     |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ~/.local/share/kontext/backup | ~/Library/Application Support/kontext/backup | LocalAppData\kontext\backup |
